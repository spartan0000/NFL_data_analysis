# NFL_data_analysis
Various projects using NFL data available on nfl_data_py.  All are works in progress.  
1. EPA - Expected points added based on the outcome of the play
2. TD regression - players whose usage should result in more TDs but has not thus far and they are candidates for a huge game due to regression to the mean.
3. RZ - red zone touches.  Red zone touches are high value touches in fantasy football and this identifies who is getting touches in the redzone which is defined as within 20 years of the opposing team's endzone.
